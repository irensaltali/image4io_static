Usage of it gets popular in the recent years, especially for animation. But it was initially introduced 32 years ago in 1987. By the time the main difference GIF brings to the industry is that, it enable users to have animated images. Which is not the main point behind the format during the development phase, their main purpose is to serve multiple images in single image format by creating better compression. By the time it turned into "GIF animation". However, initially it had few flaws. Firstly, it allowed only 256 different colors. To compare it with the general RGB channeled images, each channel contains 256 different colors. So, this caused <strong>quality issues when the GIF animation color changes quickly.</strong> Like many image formats it evolved through time and currently GIF animations do support even transparency channel. But by the time it doesn’t get replaced by any other format, which is the general behavior observed throughout the industry. Reasons behind that are actually simple,</p><p><strong>Compatibility, Marketing and Content Consumption Trends</strong></p><p>When the gif introduced, it is designed as an image format. This turned out to be a great time advantage for it. Because in HTML, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag was introduced in 1992. On the other hand, <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag was introduced in 2007. Which is the common tag that was used by many of the alternatives such as WebM, mp4 and so on. But it is also important to mention that <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is not better than the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag or vice-versa. They are just different tags used for different purposes.</p><p>For instance, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag turns out to be the exact use case for the gif since it falls under the category of “image formats”. It delivers the fundamental requirement of displaying it, even if the GIF is animated. Also, it is important to add that, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag also supports the mp4 extension. At this point you may ask, “Why does mp4 matter when compared to GIF?”. Well it does matter because,</p><p>a)      <strong> GIF has lower-quality:</strong> The GIF format uses a compression method call “Lempel-Ziv Welch” which is not an optimal for lossless compression. Also, as we mentioned previously, gif format also uses a limited color space which in combination with LZW creates artifacts. Hence, low quality.</p><p>b)      <strong>GIF has larger file size:</strong> In addition to the properties we mentioned above, the compression is done for every single frame, for each image. Unlike GIF, mp4 mainly uses H.264 compression which compresses the clip as a whole. Therefore, it is more efficient, effective and create smaller sized files.</p><p>From the reasons above many websites decided to do operations under the hood. Which can even consist of serving mp4 files in the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Also, the way that they do it is very clever. Which is letting users upload GIF formatted files, then they convert the uploaded file to mp4 format in back-end. This process can be done easily via open source software like ffmpeg. After that, they either put mp4 formatted file to the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag or <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag depending on the purpose. While choosing a tag, <strong>performance</strong> and <strong>user experience</strong> is generally the main concern.</p><!--kg-card-begin: gallery--><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="http://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2020/05/Untitled-1.jpg" width="2000" height="400" alt="What is a GIF and How To Use It Properly On Your Website?"></div></div></div></figure><!--kg-card-end: gallery--><p><strong>Performance-wise</strong>, using <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag for GIF may decrease website performance therefore has a negative effect on SEO. For example, until the video is fully loaded, the <code>window.load()</code> function won’t be triggered, therefore causing delays. Yet worse, there are javascript players. If you embed video from a streaming or a video platform it generally ends up in this category and they may cause serious performance issues. On the other hand, this is not the case for the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. Also, at this point it is important to mention that, there are also combined use cases. For instance, when GIF animations are placed <strong>inside</strong> <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag which is <strong>nested </strong>in the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag and it does few things. Firstly, it creates much more redundant delivery medium. If for whatever reason the video cannot be loaded, the GIF can be served instead. In addition to that, the controls can be removed and the video can be looped. This also brings us to the next point while choosing tags, user-experience. You won’t be able to customize the playout in <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag. But contrarily, you can make customizations on your <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag. Those customizations can include but not limited to,</p><p>·         Looping</p><p>·         Auto-playing</p><p>·         Muting</p><p><strong>User-experience</strong> is one of the key factors that determine the way of delivery for gifs. To emphasize its importance, let’s look at some example situations.</p><p>1.       Imagine you want your users to be able to download the content that you have put on your website. If you decide to deliver to content via <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag, it is much more difficult for users to download. Because unlike <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, users won’t be able to save as usual. They need to download via a 3<sup>rd</sup> party software, or you will need to provide download mechanisms. Which is obviously additional work for such a simple task. Therefore using <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag makes more sense in this situation.</p><p>2.       Imagine that your users don’t worry about downloading content from your site, rather they want to enjoy the content that you’ve share. In this case what you might want to do is deliver the content at perfect quality with sound and all of the engaging features. So, in this case delivering the content via <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag might make more sense.</p><p>As can be seen, the usage of GIF animations and other formats are heavily dependent on the use case, which can easily be understood by the vague examples given above.</p><p>However, thing mentioned above only set the scene for the gif format. Main usage increase came with the dynamic changes on the marketing and content consumption. The consumed content medium shifted towards to mini, muted and looping animations from written and other type of formats. This is because one simple reason, <strong>the ease of consumption. </strong>This actually is the main reason why GIF became a popular format.</p><p><strong>To Conclude, without a doubt GIF is one of the most widely used formats out there and it keeps growing. This is the reason why, as <a href="https://image4.io/en">image4io </a>we decided to support it. Therefore, addition to the aforementioned delivery options, we add one more to it and improving the delivery performance even further.</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p><strong>Resources:</strong></p><p>·  <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video">https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/optimizing-content-efficiency/replace-animated-gifs-with-video</a></p><p>·  <a href="https://cloudinary.com/blog/evolution_of_img_gif_without_the_gif">https://cloudinary.com/blog/evolution_of_img_gif_without_the_gif</a></p><p>·  <a href="https://rigor.com/blog/optimizing-animated-gifs-with-html5-video/">https://rigor.com/blog/optimizing-animated-gifs-with-html5-video/</a></p><p>·  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF</a></p><p>·  <a href="https://semgeeks.com/empower/how-animated-gif-emails-can-increase-your-conversion-rates/">https://semgeeks.com/empower/how-animated-gif-emails-can-increase-your-conversion-rates/</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Forgotten Format: JPEG 2000]]></title><description><![CDATA[Forgotten Format: JPEG 2000.

However, JPEG 2000 is not mentioned. Especially if we consider the overall web usage. In this brief article, we will be discussing the reasons behind that, evaluating JPEG 2000 and comparing it with its predecessor JPEG.</p><p><strong>Brief Explanation of JPEG 2000</strong></p><p>Just like JPEG, JPEG 2000 is an encoding and compression methodology developed by <a href="https://jpeg.org/jpeg2000/index.html">Joint Photographic Experts Group</a>. The main intention behind the JPEG 2000 is improving the capabilities of the existing JPEG format.  Those improvements include but not limited to,</p><p><strong>· </strong>   <strong>     Multi-layered Resolution Representation:</strong> This is a feature called ‘Pyramid’ in image processing. It is basically creating image versions with lower resolutions according to a pre-determined ratio. Generation of those layers are based on blurring and subsampling the previous reference layer.</p><p><strong>·         Robustness Against Errors:</strong>  JPEG 2000 utilizes small encoding blocks instead of larger ones. As a result, it decreases the rate of errors.</p><p><strong>·   </strong>  <strong>    Color Space Support: </strong>It supports images with any color space.</p><p><strong>·   </strong>      <strong>Transparency Support:</strong> It support alpha channel, so does the transparency.</p><p><strong>·   </strong>      <strong>Lossless Compression:</strong> JPEG 2000 supports lossless compression as well as the lossy compression. User can make the choice between the two without making additional changes.</p><p>From the above we could say that<strong> JPEG 2000 brings image quality, high dynamic range and advanced compression in one image format.</strong> To see the improvements even further, let’s go over through an example. In our previous <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/how-jpeg-works-in-4-simple-steps/">JPEG article,</a> we stated that the original JPEG format won’t be able to handle texts properly. If we compare it with the JPEG 2000, we could that JPEG 2000 improved compression technique while preserving image quality significantly.</p><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="http://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2020/04/Comparison.png" class="kg-image" alt="Forgotten Format: JPEG 2000"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>On the example above, it could be seen that JPEG 2000 is better than its predecessor JPEG which has more artifacts. Obviously, from the by looking this image making direct comparisons is not feasible and accurate thing to do. Because there are many detailed factors needed to be included which is not possible to over them in a single blog post. However, it should give the general idea. Also, an important thing to mention here is <strong>compatibility</strong>. We don’t have any problems processing and viewing JPEG and PNG images on a machine that runs Windows 10. But when we try to convert image to JPEG 2000, image editor that we use don’t support it. Also, the windows photos app won’t display it. So proprietary software must be required if someone wants work with a JPEG 2000 format.</p><p>Nevertheless, as from the common sense, it is clear that JPEG 2000 is more superior format when compared to JPEG. However, this doesn’t necessarily mean that it is ‘better’. To expand it even further, we need to compare few different factors such as,</p><p>1.       Compatibility</p><p>2.       Encoding resource consumption</p><p>3.       Sectoral Usage</p><p><strong>1.Compatibility</strong></p><p>Compatibility is a crucial factor to consider when deciding use an image format. Especially from web development perspective images should be compatible with as many browsers as they can and this is the weakness of JPEG 2000. <strong>It is currently only supported by Safari. </strong></p><p>On the other hand, formats like PNG and JPEG is supported on almost every browser. This issue is mainly caused by the effort of development. JPEG 2000 is not backwards compatible, meaning that it is not a simple modification to existing JPEG code. It is fundamentally different and based on different standard, therefore implementing it is not as easy as it seems.</p><p><strong>2. Encoding Resource Consumption</strong></p><p>When JPEG 2000 is introduced, for the time, it has high hardware requirements. Hence, companies and manufacturers become hesitant to support it. As a result, this hindered the spread of the format.</p><p><strong>3. Sectoral Usage</strong></p><p>When the mainstream and widely used image formats analyzed, we see a clear pattern. Which is the use of web platforms. Take a look at examples such as JPEG, PNG, GIF and WebP. They all are consistently used in web. This has the benefit of client-side usage. It doesn’t necessarily focus on an extremely niche topic which has low userbase. As a result, if an image format is used frequently on web platforms it significantly increases its user base and spread ratio.</p><p>However, again this is not the factor if an image format is successful or not. It is just a different metric to consider. For instance, although JPEG 2000 is not heavily used in web, it could be said that it is used commonly on digital imaging like on scanners, cameras and photocopy machines up to medical imaging systems. The high customizability enables JPEG 2000 to become a versatile image format to use in those areas.</p><p><strong>To conclude it all, JPEG 2000 is highly capable format with “different” kind of use. Even though we currently not see it commonly on daily basis, it is still frequently used format in various areas. Currently the future of JPEG 2000 is bit hazy since Joint Photographic Experts Group continuously comes up with advanced image formats such as JPEG XR and so on, as the industry move towards the <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/what-is-best-image-format-for-web-which-one-to-choose/">next-gen image formats.</a></strong></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Apply Filters to Images Using Python and OpenCV]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this blog article we go through the basics of image filters and how to apply them using OpenCV.]]></description><link>http://image4.io/en/blog/how-to-apply-filters-to-images-using-python-and-opencv/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5e761a3de34828047df372ab</guid><category><![CDATA[Image filtering]]></category><category><![CDATA[opencv]]></category><category><![CDATA[Image]]></category><category><![CDATA[images]]></category><category><![CDATA[Software]]></category><category><![CDATA[2D Convolution]]></category><category><![CDATA[Image Kernel]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Atakan Atamert]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 21 Mar 2020 16:34:50 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2020/03/CameraFilter.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2020/03/CameraFilter.jpg" alt="How to Apply Filters to Images Using Python and OpenCV"><p>In this post we will be making an introduction to various types of filters and implementing them in <a href="https://www.python.org">Python </a>using <a href="https://opencv.org">OpenCV </a>which is a computer vision library.</p><p>To begin with, we first need to understand that images are basically matrices filled with numbers spanning between 0-255 which is an 8-bit range. Those values are corresponding to the brightness level of each pixel and they are dependent on the bit range they are on. Those bit ranges are spanning between 8-bit to 30-bit. The 24-bit range is commonly referred as "true-color". The reasoning behind that is, it involves 3, 8-bit ranges for each channel in RGB.</p><p>As now we have covered how images are structured, we can move towards to the concept of <strong>“Kernel”</strong>. This is the fundamental structure behind image filtering. Kernels are minified pixel blocks with a purpose of going over the whole image and applying mathematical operations on top the corresponding pixels they are currently on. This operation is called <strong>“2D Convolution”</strong>. It works in a following manner,</p><p>	1.	Start off by picking a kernel size, it is generally picked 3x3 pixels. The kernel size changes the feature localization property. If it is large, then the features will more likely to be global instead of local. In addition to that, larger kernels are less computationally efficient due to increased amount of individual calculations. Also, larger kernels tend to reduce the noise better, although it may cause artifacts in the image. So finding the <strong>correct and balanced kernel size</strong> is quite important when applying filter to the image.</p><p>	2.	Moving further, fill out the kernel with filter specific values. For example,</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://cdn.image4.io/i4io/f_auto/blog-images/KernelSamples-1.png" alt="How to Apply Filters to Images Using Python and OpenCV">
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>Those values are the determining factor of the filter behavior. They can be set up for many purposes such as blur, sharpen-unsharpen, edge detection and so on.</p><p>	3.	After the values of filter are decided, place it in on the top left pixel of the image. The center of the kernel should correspond to that pixel. Then each pixel in the kernel is multiplied with its corresponding image counterpart and the result is summed up. To preserve the original brightness, it should be normalized. Therefore, divide the summation to the number of elements in the kernel.</p><p>	4.	Finally, apply previous step to the image from top left pixel to bottom right pixel in a row-by-row manner. In this step it is important to not overwrite the image because previous operations will probably interfere with the next operations.</p><p>As you can see from the processes above, although it algorithmically looks simple, implementing it manually is rather time consuming. Therefore, it is better to use OpenCV for implementation, which can be seen below.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><pre><code class="language-python">import cv2
import numpy as np

img = cv2.imread(&quot;HeliView.jpg&quot;)
img = cv2.resize(img, (0, 0), None, .25, .25)

gaussianBlurKernel = np.array(([[1, 2, 1], [2, 4, 2], [1, 2, 1]]), np.float32)/9
sharpenKernel = np.array(([[0, -1, 0], [-1, 9, -1], [0, -1, 0]]), np.float32)/9

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>In the code, we initially import the required libraries, which are OpenCV and <a href="https://numpy.org">Numpy</a>. After that, we read the image in the project directory, then resize it to quarter of its size in order to compare it with its multiple instances. In this case we use <strong><a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/how-jpeg-works-in-4-simple-steps/">.jpg</a> </strong>as our image format. More information about image formats could be found <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/what-is-best-image-format-for-web-which-one-to-choose/">here</a>. Then, we define our aforementioned kernels. In our case, we use 3 kernels but number of examples could be increased. Also notice that we divide every kernel to 9, in order to preserve the original brightness. Moving further, we apply our filters to image and creating multiple variations for each filter. We do that by using the <strong>filter2D </strong>method inside the OpenCV library. After we have obtained our images, we combine them horizontally using Numpy included concetenate function. And last but not least we save our image in our working directory. And the result is following,</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style="text-align: center;">

</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>The images correspond to,</p><p>	1. Original</p><p>	2. GaussianBlur</p><p>	3. MeanBlur</p><p>	4. Sharpen</p><p>From this outcome, the effects of kernel changes could be observed. As you can see the mean blur does not focus on features, it rather creates an globally even blur. On the other hand, Gaussian blur does weight greater local blurs, which can be observed by comparing the cockpit and the sky. Be sure to run code locally and observe the changes on your own, in order to have better understanding of the subject. It is highly recommended to try various kernels, especially the ones with the horizontal and vertical edge detection.</p><p>To conclude, the concept behind the filters are really interesting but one important thing to mention here is the practical usage. When the word "Image Filter" mentioned, a lot of people thing about filters that we see in photography, mobile apps or photo editing software. Those filters are actually the combination of the multiple basic filters that we mentioned during this post and many more in order to create the desired effect. </p><p>Although, those filters and programs are useful in many cases <strong>they were still unable to provide one important feature, which is practicality.</strong> It is not easy to apply effect to images without installing a dedicated program or coding your own just like we did. Which is obviously not a feasible option for many people. As from this idea, we incorporated most commonly used image processing functionalities inside <a href="https://image4.io/en">image4io</a> such as blur and sharpen.

Many of us possibly used it multiple times without really knowing how it works, when to use it and how it manages to reduce image size significantly. During this blog post we observe that the core principles are not too complex, at least on higher level.</p><p>To begin with, JPEG Compression consists of 4 steps which are the following,</p><p>1.       Colorspace Transform</p><p>2.       Discrete Cosine Transform</p><p>3.       Quantization</p><p>4.       Encoding</p><p><strong>1)</strong> 	<strong>Colorspace Transform</strong></p><p>		 According to the <em>JFIF standard </em>the colorspace should be transformed into YcBcR from RGB. Although colorspaces are way complicated to explain in this post, RGB stands for Red, Green and Blue which is the colorspace that many modern monitors use. On the other hand, YcBCr stands for Y as brightness and Cb/Cr for chrominance. Old analog color televisions used this colorspace. However, this fact raises a simple question: Why do we convert “new” into something “old”? Well, this is because the way we see colors. As humans we were unable to detect the colorspace difference between RGB and YCbCr which is caused by our low sensitivity against chrominance. </p><p>		 In addition to that, using YCbCr enables us to compress more efficiently without sacrificing too much from the perceived image quality and it is done by “Downsampling”. It is basically a sub-step which determines the color level reduction. Generally, the ratio of 4:2:0 is used. Which means that both in X and Y axis resolution is reduced by half. This ratio could be changed according to compression and quality needs.</p><p><strong>2)	Discrete Cosine Transform</strong></p><p>		 This is the main part which makes JPEG compression effective. Below you can see the 8x8 frequency representation of the 2-dimensional DCT which is commonly used in JPEG compression.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://cdn.image4.io/i4io/f_auto/blog-images/DCT-8x8.png" alt="How JPEG Works in 4 “Simple” Steps">
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>The top left corner represents the lowest frequency and bottom right represents the highest frequency. And that frequency is the frequency of the “cosine” wave. Also, what this representation enables us to do is that we can represent each image in that frequency form. For instance, think of an image of the 8x8 pixel chess board. We could say that, the high frequency part is represents our image more than the lower frequency parts. So, we can say that it has higher coefficient. Main purpose of discrete cosine transform is to identify the most prominent frequencies used in the image. As for the images larger than 8x8 pixels, JPEG compression uses a concept called block splitting. Which is basically splitting image into 8x8 pixel parts and checking the discrete cosine transform for each block.</p><p><strong>3)	Quantization</strong></p><p>		 This is the step where we use the coefficients which is found in the discrete cosine transform stage. In this part, we use “Quantization table” which has values that directly affects the amount of compression and corresponds to frequency removal threshold. This is the table that changes when we change JPEG quality in most of the image editing software. The table used in a following manner,</p><p>a) For each value in 8x8 block that is obtained from discrete cosine transform is divided to the corresponding value in the quantization table.</p><p>b) The result is rounded to the nearest integer.</p><p>By the end of the operation, the final table generally should have multiple “0” values on higher frequency ranges. That “0” comes from the threshold that we defined previously. For instance, if the values are higher than that threshold, they end up being a zero.</p><p><strong>4)</strong>	<strong>Encoding</strong></p><p>		 Obviously we place those zeros for a reason and this is the part where we use them. At that point we have a table of integers. To use then in encoding, we need to convert them into an integer stream. In order to do that we use a principle called “Zigzag Scan”. Which can be seen below.</p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="https://cdn.image4.io/i4io/f_auto/blog-images/220px-JPEG-ZigZag.svg.png" alt="How JPEG Works in 4 “Simple” Steps">
</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>In JPEG compression the “Huffman Encoding” is the general encoding method that is frequently used. It is again complicated topic which should have its own dedicated blog post, but at its core it utilizes tree structures. As a result, integer stream with multiple 0’s at the end is very beneficial to use in this algorithm.</p><p>		 To Conclude, JPEG is one of the formats that most of us use almost every single day and as we can see the combination of principles behind that is not extremely complicated but rather interesting. However, it is also necessary to state that every principle has very sophisticated and detailed versions which modern JPEG algorithms use today. This post is just a very simplistic and introductory approach to the JPEG compression.</p><p>		 As we move further to the use cases of the JPEG, we could say that it can be used in images where transparency and text sharpness is not the main concern. Since, JPEG is a lossy compression algorithm it does affect the image quality. This property of JPEG is especially more noticeable in images that has text in them. It creates artifacts around the sharp edges of the text and make it visually unpleasant. JPEG format also does not support transparency, which is also an important fact to realize. At that point using lossless formats like PNG or <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/webp-new-format-for-web-images/">WebP </a>could be a better solution. However, if neither transparency nor text cases are present in your case, it may be a wise choice to use JPEG since it reduces image size significantly. </p><p>		 Reduced image size is especially beneficial for the websites that contain high number of images, where poorly optimized images reduce the website performance and vastly increase the <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/5-ways-to-speed-up-your-website/">load time</a>. This obviously has multiple side effects such as decreased user retention, decreased revenue, wasted resources and so on. This is the exact problem that we have focused on solving at <a href="https://image4.io/en">image4io</a>.</p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>It is highly recommended to check out explanation videos of JPEG by Mike Pound on Computerphile.</p><p>JPEG Part 0 Colourspaces: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFXN9PiOGtY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LFXN9PiOGtY</a></p><p>JPEG Part 1: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_uNPbdenRs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_uNPbdenRs</a></p><p>JPEG Part 2 DCT: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2aEzeMDHMA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2aEzeMDHMA</a></p><p>JPEG wiki: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG</a></p><p>Chroma Subsampling: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling</a></p><p>Discrete Cosine Transform: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform</a></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why You Need Digital Asset Management Software in Your Company]]></title><description><![CDATA[Having the best digital asset management software enables companies to achieve a centralized location for all their virtual content.

Thus, a digital asset management software is crucial in managing and organizing such content, as well as monitoring its access and utilization.</p><p>Having the best digital asset management software enables companies to achieve a centralized location for all their virtual content. By optimizing images, digital businesses can improve their website’s performance and visitor engagement and, in turn, potentially <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/what-is-conversion-rate/">increase conversion rate</a>.</p><p>That said, the capabilities of digital asset management software extend beyond that of a unified storage location for digital content. Here are some of the many reasons why your company needs a digital asset management software.</p><p><strong>5 Reasons to Use Digital Asset Management Software in Your Company</strong><br></p><p><strong>1. Managing and Customizing Metadata</strong><br></p><p>One of the problems of having too many digital and creative assets and not utilizing DAM technology to manage them is the massive amount of time lost in searching for items. When you are working with mountains of photos and videos, it can be quite difficult to locate specific images and clips if you forget which folder you placed them in and in which computer or device.<br></p><p>With digital asset management software, you’re not only able to keep track of your files, but you can also enrich each asset with embedded information called metadata. Metadata such as origin, technical specifications, item description, dates, permissions, and associated keywords make your digital assets easily searchable.<br></p><p>Imagine the amount of work you and your team can accomplish if you can quickly jumpstart your design projects because your design templates are retrieved in seconds, not minutes or hours. You don’t have to rack and wring your brain remembering file names and folders and lose precious time in the process. Most digital asset management systems come with filters to make your search more unique and customized, thus accelerating your search.</p><p><strong>2. Eliminate Duplicates and Multiple Versions</strong><br></p><p>Working on campaigns entail working with tons of creative images, templates, and files. <a href="https://financesonline.com/logo-trends/">Graphic design software trends</a> show that managing your visuals is crucial for building your brand’s identity online. Internet and cloud technology enabled people to share images and clips with ease and speed. But such an arrangement can lead to serious problems such as missing files and unapproved formats and sizes. On top of that, you and your team may have to deal with complicated and perplexing folder structures that contain similar images under different file names and formats.<br></p><p>A digital asset management software eliminates such problems by harmonizing all assets, ensuring all workers and departments have access to a single version of assets. Whenever an asset is updated, it is synchronized across departments and devices in real-time.<br></p><p>This harmonization across multiple departments ensures that every image, video, audio, and other digital content used for campaigns and other purposes are one and the same. It removes any probability of mismatches as well as the use of outdated, unapproved assets.<br></p><p><strong>3. Improve Client Relationships</strong><br></p><p>Professional photographers work with tons of digital assets on a regular basis. Thus, a digital asset management software for photographers is not surprising. In fact, most digital asset management systems are geared towards photographers along with videographers, marketers, graphic designers, and other professionals who are involved in the asset creation process.<br></p><p>Aside from organizing and tracking their photos, photographers use their digital asset management system to help them create backups of their images. This is important since they tend to work with a variety of clients, which range from individual to corporate customers.<br></p><p>With a digital asset management solution, they can safely and securely back up photos of their clients. In the event of an emergency, they can quickly retrieve their clients’ images and retain their business. In instances where clients lose or damage their copies, photographers can quickly re-furnish them with another set of images in a flash.<br></p><p>When it comes to your website, having optimized images can <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/5-ways-to-speed-up-your-website/">speed up your website’s performance</a>. With that, pages can quickly load so your visitors won’t lose interest from waiting and stay on your site longer.<br></p><p><strong>4. Protect Your Digital Assets</strong><br></p><p>Utilizing a digital asset management software encrypts all your digital content, protecting them from unauthorized access and use. Aside from encrypting them in your storage center, a digital asset management solution also encrypts them in all channels you use for sending and sharing.<br></p><p>This reduces, if not eliminate, reliance on sharing assets via FTP. File transfer protocol, or FTP, has been the standard for sharing and sending large files during the early years of the  Internet. But FTP is known to be a risky way of sharing files. The process is insecure and unauthenticated. This means passwords are revealed in clear text, allowing unauthorized parties to access and sniff data during file transfers.<br></p><p>FTP is so risky that even the FBI advises people and companies against its use. Back in 2017, the <a href="https://www.databreachtoday.com/fbi-warns-healthcare-entities-threats-to-ftp-servers-a-9800">FBI released a report</a> stating that criminal elements are actively targeting FTP servers to steal information primarily from healthcare establishments and facilities.<br></p><p>The added protection provided by digital asset management systems ensures that your files are safe and secure during the transfer process. You can also add watermarks to boost the security of your visual assets.<br></p><p><strong>5. Sell/Distribute Your Assets Better</strong><br></p><p>If your business is into selling and/or distributing digital content, then you will boost your business productivity and profitability with a digital asset management system. Most DAM systems are built to integrate with multiple product content networks, product management software, and product information management systems. This helps you organize your libraries and assets as well as determine what content should be in line for sale or distribution.<br></p><p><strong>Tool for Improving Efficiency</strong><br></p><p>The majority of business organizations put in a substantial amount of money, time, effort, and other resources into making more digital assets. That said, it is just recently that digital asset management software is seeing widespread adoption and implementation in major business sectors and industries.<br></p><p>The reasons mentioned in the article are only some of the digital asset management examples you can utilize. And more businesses are realizing its importance. <br></p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/digital-asset-management-software-market-global-trends-share-growth-opportunity-and-2025-2019-11-05">November 2019 research by MarketWatch</a>, the digital asset management market was valued at $1.8 billion back in 2017. The increasing proliferation of digital content (images, videos, documents) will drive the demand for digital asset management systems and increase the market value to as much as $6.7 billion by 2025.<br></p><p>Companies are realizing now that the only way to get more value from their digital assets is to ensure that their team members can immediately and effortlessly locate and retrieve them whenever needed. Put another way, digital asset management software acts like an improved media library that enhances efficiency and streamlines everything. It speeds up the creative workflow by removing bottlenecks, which then results in better productivity and profitability.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What is an image CDN?]]></title><description><![CDATA[What is image CDN and why should you care about it.

It finds the proper format for each and every user, it determines screen size and resolution. With this knowledge, image CDN can manipulate the image to produce the best version of the image for each individual visitor.</p><p>With image CDN, you do not have to store different versions of the image in the storage. You can store only the original image and then manipulate that image on-the-fly to the visitor. Of course, image processing features are required for manipulating the image. In this case, image CDN is as essential as the image processing features for image management solutions.</p><h2 id="why-is-it-useful">Why is it useful?</h2><p>☻ It increases website speed.

In this post, we will look into more technical details about how we can do it.</p><p>As we talked about previously, Responsive Design is an approach that makes websites show in multiple devices appropriate to its width and height. As <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">Ethan Marcotte</a> explained in its article in 2010, there are three key aspects of a website to be responsive:</p><ul><li>Using <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/fluidgrids/">fluid grids</a> or fluid design</li><li>Using media query</li><li>Using responsive images</li></ul><p>Let's dive right in!</p><h2 id="fluid-grids">Fluid Grids</h2><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><div style="text-align: center;">
      <img src="https://cdn.image4.io/i4io/f_auto/blog-images/Content-is-like-water.jpg" alt="Responsive Web Design (Part-1)">
</div>
<!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>It's kind of a strange way of explaining this but if you have content like a "fluid", wherever you put your content, it will take the space and shows it.</p><p>The fluid grid concept is to designing webpage contents/elements proportion to width and height of the container itself- not to container's pixel value. Giving fixed values makes our website more "solid" and not responsive at all.</p><p>How do we achieve this? That's very simple - change all the values with the appropriate percentage. For example, if you have a <code>div</code> tag that wraps all the content, instead of giving any pixel value, you simply give percent values.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>.content-div{
  max-width:80%;
  height:auto;
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>As you can see above, we can give a div a max-width of 80% of the parent's width and height appropriate to its content.</p><p>You can't always use <code>%</code> unit since some properties - like font-sizes - cannot have it. But we have to scale them anyway. So what we do about them? - <code>em</code> to the rescue! </p><p>The <code>em</code> unit is a relative measure unit that computes according to the font-size of the current element. For example:</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>html {
    font-size: 10px;
}
div {
    background-color: red;
    width: 40em; // 400px
}
p {
    font-size: 1.2em; //12 px
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>As you can see, <code>p</code> tags will have 12px value. <code>em</code> also can be used instead of px values of a given element. <code>em</code> is a very useful tool for responsive design and we should use them.</p><p>In addition to <code>em</code> , there is a unit called <code>rem</code> which is very similar to the <code>em</code> with a slight difference - it is calculated according to the root element - <code>html</code>. If you defined an <code>html</code> font-size, <code>rem</code> will be using that px value.</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>html {
    font-size: 10px;
}
div {
    font-size:5px;
    background-color: red;
    width: 40rem; // 400px
}
p {
    font-size: 1.2rem; //12 px
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>As you can see above, the width of the <code>div</code> is still 400px even though the <code>div</code>'s font-size is 15px. If we have used <code>em </code>instead of <code>rem</code>, we would have a 200px-width <code>div</code>. </p><h2 id="flexbox">Flexbox</h2><p>Since we have started to talk about fluid design, we have to talk about flexbox. Flexbox is a layout model that allows its content element to align and position themself according to their container. Flexbox is a great way to implement a responsive design. </p><p>Using flexbox is simple: you simply add <code>flex</code> attribute to a given element's <code>display</code> attribute</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>.container {
  display: flex;
  width:500px;
}

.content{
  width:48px;
  height:48px;
  margin:auto;
}</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>If you use the <code>content</code> class inside of the <code>container</code>, you will see that <code>content</code> will position itself inside of the container according to its width value (I give px values to make sure the reader would understand the flex concept). </p><p>Flexbox is very useful for many situations, but it's not a silver bullet - you can't use it for all situations. For example, it may cause problems when used for <a href="https://jakearchibald.com/2014/dont-use-flexbox-for-page-layout/">page layout</a>.  </p><p>All in all, it is a great tool to have and use when it's necessary. You can learn more about flexbox from <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">here </a>and also practice from <a href="https://flexboxfroggy.com/">here </a>( I highly suggest this playground)</p><p>In my next post, we will be looking at the media-queries and responsive images and how we utilize them to achieve responsiveness.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The 5 Most Important Things To Speed Up Your Website]]></title><description><![CDATA[In today's internet people tend to leave slow web pages.

While response time is approximately 10 milliseconds to a server which is located in the same/near city with the client, it can also be 400 milliseconds with server and client are located at different continents.</p><h3 id="3-optimize-images">3.

</div><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>When it comes to the load time rather than TTFB, images hold the belt of delaying the web page to load. An unoptimized image can be twenty times large than it's optimized form. An image can be optimized by:<br>☻ Converting it to new generation formats.<br>☻ Resizing it at the server-side instead of resizing it in the Html/CSS code to fit it into the frame on the page.<br>☻ Efficiently encode images. In some cases, you can sacrifice a little quality to gain some speed. Encoding an image with 90% quality and lossy compression would not make a difference that the human eye can detect but it can halve the size.<br>☻ Using an efficient cache policy with Cache-Control and expires headers.</p><h3 id="4-review-your-hosting-package">4. Review Your Hosting Package</h3><p>If you’ve taken these previous steps and your website is still loading slowly, you may want to consider a new hosting package. On a typical shared hosting account, you might be sharing server space with dozens of other companies, which can impact the speed of your website since a number of people are using the same server. If shared hosting no longer meets your needs, consider dedicated hosting.</p><h3 id="5-set-browser-caching">5. Set Browser Caching</h3><p>Browser caching stores cached versions of static resources, a process that quickens page speed tremendously and reduces server lag. When a user visits a page on your website, the cached version usually displays unless it has changed since it was last cached. This means the browser saves a lot of requests to your server and improves load speed for your site.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>You can check <a href="http://image4.io/en/blog/5-ways-to-speed-up-your-website/image4.io/en">image4io</a> for all of these features and much more beyond.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Clever Way of Formatting Images: Auto Format]]></title><description><![CDATA[In this blog post, we go through the very basics of two images formats.

Each of them serves a special purpose, but in this post we will be looking at which formats are suitable for webpages and what is image auto-formatting. To begin with, we first need to understand the basics of the two most commonly used formats, <strong>JPEG</strong> and <strong>PNG</strong>. PNG stand for "Portable Network Graphics". It is a <strong>lossless image format</strong> which can support RGB, RGBA and CMYK colorspaces. JPEG is a bit different. It stands for "Joint Photographic Experts Group" which is the committee that created and maintains the standards. Unlike PNG, JPEG is a <strong>lossy image format</strong>, which means the quality of image decreases as well as the storage space. However, the level of compression is variable therefore it can be adjusted according to the user's needs.</p><p>We get the basics but what is next-gen image formats? According to the Google, next-gen image formats are:</p><blockquote><em><strong>"</strong><a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/webp"><strong>JPEG 2000, JPEG XR,</strong> and <strong>WebP</strong> are image formats that have superior compression and quality characteristics compared to their older JPEG and PNG counterparts. Encoding your images in these formats rather than JPEG or PNG means that <strong>they will load faster and consume less cellular data.</strong></a><strong>"</strong></em></blockquote><p>What that means is that next-gen image formats have much more advanced compression methods. Therefore, they are better to use in websites for getting a better performance. However, there are still some issues. You cannot simply convert all images in your website to a single format. Not every browser supports these image formats. Also, every image should have a suitable format for its required purpose and it should be as small as possible. </p><p>For that reason, we need image auto-formatting.</p><!--kg-card-begin: hr--><hr><!--kg-card-end: hr--><p>What is image auto-formatting? <strong>Image auto-formatting</strong> is a simple system that checks browser compatibility and decides what to do accordingly. In <a href="https://image4.io/en">image4io</a>, our formatter works in a following way;</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ol>
<li>To enable it, image format selector needs to be selected to &quot;auto&quot;.</li>
<li>It fetches the browser info and decides that if the browser is compatible with the format &quot;.webp&quot;.</li>
<li>If so it converts the image to .wepb and returns the resulting image.</li>
<li>If not it returns the image in its original format.</li>
</ol>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>It may seems simple at first sight, but it is useful feature to have, since users save a lot of time. Converting each image manually is a really labor intensive task.</p><p>In addition, features of the auto-formatter can be expanded in the future to support additional formats depending on the browser support of those formats.			</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Responsiveness - An Overview]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s world, the internet is an inevitable reality that shapes our everyday life.

This is partly because of mobile usage. Mobile internet usage has enabled consumers to access information wherever they want on the go. Mobile internet usage is over 50% of the total internet consumption which makes the consumer's first choice.</p><p>This reality also changed our perception of everything we know about websites. Websites have to respond to the device’s sizes and show their content accordingly. In this article, we will look more into it how to achieve this.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h3>Responsive Design</h3><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>In the earlier days of web design, websites are built to target particular sizes. If the page is smaller or bigger than expected, the result is the unfitting buttons and images. Introduction of the mobile devices, this problem escalated quickly because of the different sizes of each device. Since we can’t simply make websites to each size, responsive design has emerged as a solution.</p><p>Responsive design, in its core, is designing a website regardless of the size of the device. As you shrinking or enlarging the size of the page, the elements of the website position themselves accordingly.</p><p>The term responsive design first used by Ethan Marcotte in <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/">his post</a>. He explained how to achieve the responsive design and soon it became the de-facto approach to design websites.</p><p>People started to implement the responsive approach- they know how to do it but converting the old websites to mobile-friendly ones needed some work. So they proposed two approaches: <strong>Graceful Degradation</strong> and <strong>Progressive Advancement</strong>.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h5>Graceful Degradation</h5><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>Simply, this approach is to design the full-fledged website with its all complex components then remove their content to fit in a smaller size. Removing some of the complex content becomes a necessity for smaller screens because you want your audience to receive the content much simpler. Since there is little space to work with, showing the whole website on a tiny screen is troublesome for them. </p><p>To apply graceful degradation, first, you want to determine what is your primary content or features to be shown to your visitors. What are your essential functions that your site operates? What is the most important aspect of that particular site? Once you decide, you can remove it so that it simplifies for a mobile screen.</p><p>The issue with this approach is to separate core content and functions with the supplementary ones. When you design the full-fledged site with all complex components, you integrate the core components with supplementary ones. It becomes harder to define supplementary functions. Even though you find the supplementary content/function and remove it, remaining core functions may lose the integrity of the content. Because of this issue, Progressive Advancement is proposed.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><h5>Progressive Advancement</h5><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img src="https://cdn.image4.io/i4io/f_auto/blog-images/responsive-2.png" alt="Responsiveness - An Overview"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>Progressive Advancement or Progressive Enhancement is to design a website to a smaller screen with the minimum content/functions and to iteratively improve upon it. This approach is sometimes called the mobile-first approach. Designing first to smaller screens has its own problems but it lays out the core components of your site.</p><p>This approach is so useful for the compatibility of your browsers. If the mobile browser renders your site, it renders in desktop browsers. If you want to improve the user experience for the desktop, you can do it without changing the mobile design.</p><p>In the next post, I will delve into the technical side of the responsive approach and how we implement the basics.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Does Website Speed Affect Digital Business?]]></title><description><![CDATA[Web page speed is directly related to conversion rate and bounce rate, which are critical digital marketing metrics for digital businesses. ]]></description><link>http://image4.io/en/blog/how-does-website-speed-affect-digital-business/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5dbf0e831a6e422e56bd4789</guid><category><![CDATA[web speed]]></category><category><![CDATA[page insight]]></category><category><![CDATA[GT Metrix]]></category><category><![CDATA[Website Speed]]></category><category><![CDATA[page speed insights]]></category><category><![CDATA[bounce rate]]></category><category><![CDATA[conversion rate]]></category><category><![CDATA[digital business]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Deniz Güreler]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Nov 2019 09:53:11 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="http://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2019/11/conversion.jpg" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="http://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2019/11/conversion.jpg" alt="How Does Website Speed Affect Digital Business?"><p>When it comes to website speed, the competition takes place in milliseconds. Although there are many important factors involved in generating sales, page speed is obviously the most important one. Basically, all efforts you made for content, SEO and user experience can’t be effective if your website isn’t fast enough. The statistics show that internet users generally expect a website to load in nearly 2 seconds. As speed becomes more and more important in digital world, websites that take long to load may not have any chance to reach their potential customers and attract them at all. A visitor is much likely to switch to other option instead of waiting for a slow website to load.</p><h3 id="impacts-of-speed-on-conversions-and-bounce-rate">Impacts of Speed on Conversions and Bounce Rate</h3><p>Having said that, web page speed is directly related to conversion rate and bounce rate, which are critical digital marketing metrics for digital businesses. <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/what-is-conversion-rate/">Conversion rate</a> is simply the percentage of visitors that take desired action of a particular website to total visitors. Researches indicate that fast loading pages also positively affects customer’s relationship with brands. Website speed affects customer satisfaction, and supports customer engagement. Thus, a slow website might mean dissatisfied customers which eventually damages customer life cycle and brand’s reputation. Customer research lab indicates that: “66% of customers said website performance influences their impression of the company and 33 percent of customers have a negative impression of a company with a poor performing website. </p><p>Bounce rate is simply the percentage rate of visitors on your site that viewed only one page and then left without any further action. Unless you aim to direct your traffic to a specific land page or such, a high bounce rate negatively affect the customer journey. For example a high bounce rate it could mean a huge potential decrease in sales and sales revenue for e-commerce businesses.</p><p>Google states that  53% of mobile visitors leave a website if the load time exceeds 3 seconds. There isn’t a certain ideal webpage load time applicable for all websites since each website includes different sized images, files, codes and etc. However, it can be said that visitors expect all of them to load fastly, irregardless of their size and location. As of July 2018, mobile website page speed also officially became a search engine ranking parameter. Thus, webpage load time also have impact on digital marketing efforts of digital businesses when it comes to creating content and SEO.</p><h3 id="importance-of-measuring-website-page-speed">Importance of Measuring Website Page Speed</h3><p>To assess website page speed and its impacts on digital business perfectly, exact measurement is needed. Once the current speed of website is known, it can be compared with industry averages, competitors and regions.</p><ul><li><strong>Page Speed Insights</strong></li></ul><p>Google Page Speed Insights is the most popular free online tool when it comes to measure website page speed. It provides detailed description of website speed on both desktop and mobile. Page Speed Insights also provides a detailed explanation of how to improve your website speed. These suggestions also shows the priority degrees of each step, so that you will know which action must be taken first.</p><ul><li><strong>GT Metrix</strong></li></ul><p>GT Metrix is another tool that offers website page speed and performance optimization. Digital businesses can use GT Metrix to test their website speeds from different browsers and different countries and assess what impacts the website speed more. GT Metrix suggests the ways to improve a slow website as Page Speed Insights. Another feature of GT Metrix is that users can set alerts to get notified when website starts loading slower than a certain speed unexpectedly, for example due to high traffic or a server issue.</p><p>To numerically see the effects of milliseconds in e-commerce, Amazon case might be a good example. Only one second of slowdown in webpage speed could cost $1.6 billion of revenue per year for Amazon. And the case studies show that every 100 miliseconds of improved website speed increases conversions and generates 1% increase in revenue as well. Another example is that for every 100 miliseconds of slowdown, 20% of Google’s traffic is lost. This is why every online business should take time to optimize their web page load time. Although it might seem as complicated and long to deal with, it actually affects the overall performance of all digital marketing efforts. At the end of the day, any marketing and customer engagement effort become pointless if these can’t be communicated with the visitors at all.

As understood from its name, this important marketing metric indicates the desired actions you want your visitors to take. As there are many points throughout the sales funnel, conversion rates may differ. For example, if you are interested in lead generation you can specify newsletter signups as conversions, while add to cart can be another conversion metric focused on sales. However, all conversion rates refer to the same ultimate goal of businesses: producing sales. Each of these conversions make your visitors one step closer to being a customer. Common conversions can be submitting a form, signing up, downloading whitepaper and bulletins, making a purchase, etc.</p><p>The simple calculation of conversion rate is:</p><p>Conversion Rate = Number of visitors took the call to action (CTA) / total number of visitors.</p><p>However, as business goals differ across industries, it is best to search for industry averages first. 3% conversion rate may be seen as perfect for car industry, while it may sign a problem for electronics industry.</p><h3 id="importance-of-tracking-conversion-rates">Importance of Tracking Conversion Rates</h3><p>Tracking conversion rate is important for 2 main points: to assess effectiveness of your marketing efforts and performance of your website. Conversion rates can be general or specific according to your needs. For example, you can track overall conversion rate to understand how much your website generates, <em>in this case converts</em>, traffic or track keyword conversion rate to decide which keyword to separate budget when advertising. Overall, each conversion rate shows the performance of your online marketing efforts. Assessed right, conversion rates help you to make right decisions throughout your online marketing process and take better actions.</p><p>There is no certain good conversion rate, as there are many important factors such as size of your data set, chosen timeframe and industry characteristics. After searching for industry averages, actual conversion rates must be assessed with ROI as well. At the end of the day, high click rate doesn’t mean anything if they don’t convert to purchases. ROI of the marketing campaigns actually helps to interpret the conversion rates since it shows the effectiveness and profitability.</p><h3 id="how-to-increase-conversion-rate">How to Increase Conversion Rate?</h3><p>There are 2 steps to increase the conversion rates: first, evaluating the offer given to visitors. It is a critical starting point, since a non-attractive offer or call to action (CTA) may be the simple cause of low conversion rate. The second step is designing and optimizing website or landing pages to improve conversion rate. The process is called conversion rate optimization. Conversion rate optimization actually helps to convert the traffic you already have, which in turn leads to more revenue or less marketing spending.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>1. Landing Page Creation</strong><br>
To compete in highly competitive online market, businesses have so little time to show their unique values&amp;offers. If your marketing efforts include paid advertising on different platforms, you should meet your paid traffic in a landing page that is created spesifically for them instead of your homepage. In this way, the traffic coming from paid advertisements can engage with your business without losing interest.</p>
<p><strong>2. Building Hypothesis</strong><br>
When optimizing conversion rates, it is important to look at how well your website or application is designed. Apart from the offer, the website design also affects the actions your visitors would take. By building hypothesis about why the chosen conversion rate might be low, you can start to take actions to improve the conversion rate. For example, more apparent call to action or signup buttons might be needed. Overall, you should come up with potential reasons of any low conversion rate and come up with relevant implementations, such as catchy media, significant buttons, user friendly interface, etc.</p>
<p><strong>3. A/B Testing</strong><br>
Last but not least, A/B testing helps to interpret the effectiveness of all conversion rate optimization efforts. First, set up two different versions of any element on your website such as headlines, call to action buttons, font sizes, colors, etc. and split your traffic between these versions. A/B testing basicly supports the evaluation of the hypotheses built on low conversion rates. If the control variant that includes the potential changes indicates higher conversion, then you can implement these changes to your website.</p>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>There are many online tools to track conversion rates and support conversion rate optimization efforts businesses can use. Although it may seem time-consuming and effortful process at first, conversion rate tracking and optimization are actually complementary steps of all online marketing process. Online marketing efforts are measurable but to gain competitive advantage, businesses must also take action based on the results they get. With conversion rate tracking, businesses can focus their marketing campaigns on most profitable areas and optimize what they already have. With the increasing use of technology, digital competition is taking place in every little action the potential customers take. While AI is becoming widespread in marketing world, businesses have also chance to collect and interpret personalised customer habits in their own unique ways. Understanding the customer and directing the marketing efforts towards what they want is the key to winning in online business world.</p><p><strong>use image4io to optimize your websites' images.</strong><br><a href="https://console.image4.io/Auth/SignUp">SIGN UP FOR FREE</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Source:</strong></p>

The platform first launched in 2010 as an iPhone app, and reached 1 million users in just 2 months, back in that day. Compared to Twitter and Foursquare, which reached 1 million monthly users in 2 years, Instagram is number one social platform for many users. While Instagram changed the way of social media through communication, engagement and inspiration, it also became a huge marketing channel for brands. The statistics show that 25 million brands have Instagram accounts, and 80% of Instagram users follow at least one brand. So, why Instagram became so popular and active in our lives, and why should brands pay attention to Instagram marketing?</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>User Friendliness</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>First of all, Instagram’s success can be explained with its user friendliness. The application interface is designed to be used and understood easily. Also, Instagram concentrates on mobile, which contributes to engagement in daily life. It first launched as a mobile app, and still some features are found only in mobile app rather than website. Thus, the social photo sharing application becomes much more accessible and instant as it promises. The application provides easy to use snap, edit, filter tools and fast loading feed for its users. Finally, the user actions are also designed to be easy and fun: double tap for likes, scrolling down for seeing further.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>While other social media platforms are based on sharing thoughts and life events, Instagram focuses on creativity through visuality. Visuality makes the platform more personal and differentiated. Instagram is a social media platform which puts images on the center and supports the personalized posts through hashtags. It becomes much more easier and exciting to share instant moments, daily activities or even outfits. The platform draws its strength from the users’ eagerness to create something about themselves. Overall, Instagram is all about sprinkling inspiration over daily routines. Instagram also changed the way of photography of course, the statistics show that every pictures taken in 2 minutes now exceeds total number of photos taken during 19<sup>th</sup>century.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>It is all about engagement</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Creativity turns Instagram into a platform where people create their portfolio, visual diary or artsy place. This helps Instagram to become more involved in daily lives. The “followers” attribute instead of friends list makes this platform even more influencing. People can follow various accounts to get inspired, have ideas or even get updated instantly. The platform has formed its own habits, for example the hashtag usage can be personal or refer to brands. The challenges or habits such as “throwbackthursday” encourage people to involve more and more.</p><p>In the end of the day, Instagram becomes a naturally dynamic marketing platform for brands as well. Since the inspiration is at the center of the platform, brands can engage with their followers or promote their products. For example, the statistics indicate that 70% of most used hashtags are branded. Another important statistic is that e<a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/15-09-15-how_does_your_brand_stack_up_on_facebook_twitter_and_instagram/">ngagement with brands</a> on Instagram is 10 times higher than Facebook, 54 times higher than Pinterest, and 84 times higher than Twitter.</p><p>On the other hand, Instagram’s visuality and belongingness also encourages users to join into marketing process. Influencer marketing becomes more and more important in these days, since people prefer to trust people they can relate themselves to, not only big name celebrities. In Instagram, micro marketing has as much importance as macro marketing since they promote the products and promotions more realistically. Also, the dynamic platform has given rise to user generated content which marketers love. Branded challenges or campaigns encourage people to share their personal experiences which eventually becomes free marketing of the brand. This can be associated with word-of-mouth way of traditional marketing, but in a much more dynamic way.</p><p>Besides all of these features, Instagram also keeps providing marketing advantages for the brands. For example, in-app purchases facilitates promotions even more. Brands can post their stylish-inspirational pictures, and any user can simply view the prices and buy the products through Instagram. Given that 60% of Instagram users discover new products on this platform, this is a huge advantage for brands.</p><p>Finally, visual marketing has a huge role in marketing with the rise of visual social platforms, especially Instagram. Visuality contributes to marketing efforts of brands through customer engagement. Images are extremely helpful when it comes to attract potential customers in the blink of an eye, especially in today’s competitive market conditions. Creative part of Instagram also supports customer engagement, leading to bilateral communication between parties.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><strong>Source:</strong></p>

To run their applications on these servers, developers had to implement, maintain, update and continuously monitor the infrastructure. Although cloud computing have changed the way of setting up the infrastructure, developers are still responsible for the maintenance of it. For example when choosing the amount to rent, excessive server space is rented to ensure that an unexpected traffic or peak times wouldn’t break the application. Although auto-scale features are served by cloud vendors, there are still risks of over payment, for example a DDoS Attack would mean an extreme scaling and eventually a very huge cost. Developers must manage the infrastructure effectively. This leads to a lot more work for developers, taking their attention from the business goals and application itself.</p><p>That is where “serverless” comes in. Serverless computing is an execution model where the cloud vendor takes the responsibility of resource allocation. Serverless allows developers to shift operational concerns and whole infrastructure management to cloud vendors. In serverless architecture, cloud vendor provides backend services when needed.</p><p><strong>Microservices and Serverless</strong></p><p>Microservices is an architectural pattern, which is based on building separated individual services that makes one job really well. With this pattern, developers can develop services that are not dependent on each other, each service can scale independently and build much more flexible fault tolerant systems.</p><p>Before serverless, microservices were managed and deployed on containers. Containers are form of virtualized operating systems, which are isolated from each others’ context. Even though environments are separated, each service that are deployed to containers must be monitored and scaled if needed. With serverless in game, these worries are now gone. Because there are no servers or containers to be maintained, developers deploy their services to serverless, sit back and watch their code run without any worries.</p><p><strong>Advantages of Serverless</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>
<p>No Management<br>
Thanks to serverless, developers don’t need to worry about anything but the application itself. The provision issues before the development and maintenance of servers afterwards, they are handled by cloud vendors, not by DevOps teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced Costs<br>
Since no provision is needed, developers or DevOps teams don’t have to pre-rent excessive server spaces. The cloud vendors are responsible for resource allocation and the pricing is based on the number of executions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automatic Scaling<br>
While the resource allocation means lower operational costs, it also reduces effort needed. Developers don’t have to think about peak traffic or downtime issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decreased Latency<br>
Backend as a Service (BaaS) means that the servers are provided through cloud system. This helps to distribute servers to different geographic areas. Since no fixed server is rented and servers work on demand only, it is possible to run the code closer to end user. At the end of the day, latency decreases and end user experience improves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agility<br>
Since less provision is needed and deployable units are smaller, it becomes faster and easier to have a business idea and make it happen through deployment. With serverless, teams can focus on their product only, and this leads to much more time for updates and product features. In the end, serverless helps companies to gain competitive edge due to ability to innovate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p><strong>Disadvantages of Serverless</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>
<p>Cold Starts<br>
In serverless, the codes are held in storage. When a request comes, the code is brought up and then it starts working. Only thereafter the response is sent. This process is called “cold start” and it can take a lot time. When no additional requests come in a certain time, the server becomes inactive again and the same process of cold start happens when next request comes. The duration of cold starts varies between different cloud vendors, however it is too slow when compared to warm starts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Server Usage<br>
If the application is always working, then serverless works as if a rented server. If the server is up 24/7, then the cost per execution exceeds the rent prices. This causes even higher cost than rented server systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Limited Working Times<br>
Limited working times may become a disadvantage when working with serverless. There is a time limit for the code to run after a request comes. Thus, if the time limit is exceeded, the code stops execution, the request is cancelled and the system raises an error. This problem may decelerate the business due to nonresponses.</p>

As of 2018, the images on a web site generally cover 64% of the site.</p><p>Using relevant images on your website will lead the visitors to focus on the content and visit the site again. However, there are some issues to consider when using images on your website.</p><p>When images are not optimized, they occupy a lot of space in the server. This reduces its performance and causes your web site to slow down. You should optimize your images to be able to offer a perfect user experience. This is critical when it comes to acquiring new visitors or retaining your existing customers.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>Find The Right Image Format</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Given the large image density of websites, the impact of images on website performance is huge. Image formats determine the size and quality of images. Therefore finding the right image format is essential for website performance. </p><p></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img src="https://cdn.image4.io/i4io/f_auto/blog-images/image-formats-800x444-2-1.png" alt="Contribution of Image Optimization to Web Performance"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p></p><p>To read our article about image formats; <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/what-is-best-image-format-for-web-which-one-to-choose/">What Is The Best Image Format For Web? Which One To Choose?</a></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>Resize the Images</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>While resizing the images, xhtml and css can be used. But it is not recommended. Because that way, visitors download the original image from server and resize it at their side. This is an inefficient way in terms of bandwidth usage and image load time. It is a better practise to apply manipulations such as resizing at the server side.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>Compress Images</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Image compression is one of the most important step to increase your website speed. You should choose best option depending on your usage needs. Most common compression formats are jpeg, png and webp. Webp format has best compression ratio over the other ones in most scenarios.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>Change the URL Structure of Your Images</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The url structure of the images in the source code is one the factors that affect the website speed. You can simplify the source code by removing unnecessary extensions from the url. </p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li><strong>Use CSS Sprite</strong></li>
</ul>
<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>Css Sprite is simpyle the combination of images on your website. These images are combined together and stored as if a single file. In this way, no matter how many images on your site are merged into this file, it will open as a single image file. This method shortens the load time of your website. It also helps to reduce the page size.</p><p>As a result, you can use these simple methods to prevent the negative effects of your large image sizes on your website. These methods will not only help you to save space, but also improve user experience and increase your potential visitors. </p><p>Sources:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><a href="https://www.maxcdn.com/one/visual-glossary/css-sprites/">https://www.maxcdn.com/one/visual-glossary/css-sprites/</a><br>
