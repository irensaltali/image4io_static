          <p>Each day, people interact with digital assets hundreds, if not thousands, of times. Thus, a digital asset management software is crucial in managing and organizing such content, as well as monitoring its access and utilization.</p><p>Having the best digital asset management software enables companies to achieve a centralized location for all their virtual content. By optimizing images, digital businesses can improve their website’s performance and visitor engagement and, in turn, potentially <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/what-is-conversion-rate/">increase conversion rate</a>.</p><p>That said, the capabilities of digital asset management software extend beyond that of a unified storage location for digital content. Here are some of the many reasons why your company needs a digital asset management software.</p><p><strong>5 Reasons to Use Digital Asset Management Software in Your Company</strong><br></p><p><strong>1. Managing and Customizing Metadata</strong><br></p><p>One of the problems of having too many digital and creative assets and not utilizing DAM technology to manage them is the massive amount of time lost in searching for items. When you are working with mountains of photos and videos, it can be quite difficult to locate specific images and clips if you forget which folder you placed them in and in which computer or device.<br></p><p>With digital asset management software, you’re not only able to keep track of your files, but you can also enrich each asset with embedded information called metadata. Metadata such as origin, technical specifications, item description, dates, permissions, and associated keywords make your digital assets easily searchable.<br></p><p>Imagine the amount of work you and your team can accomplish if you can quickly jumpstart your design projects because your design templates are retrieved in seconds, not minutes or hours. You don’t have to rack and wring your brain remembering file names and folders and lose precious time in the process. Most digital asset management systems come with filters to make your search more unique and customized, thus accelerating your search.</p><p><strong>2. Eliminate Duplicates and Multiple Versions</strong><br></p><p>Working on campaigns entail working with tons of creative images, templates, and files. <a href="https://financesonline.com/logo-trends/">Graphic design software trends</a> show that managing your visuals is crucial for building your brand’s identity online. Internet and cloud technology enabled people to share images and clips with ease and speed. But such an arrangement can lead to serious problems such as missing files and unapproved formats and sizes. On top of that, you and your team may have to deal with complicated and perplexing folder structures that contain similar images under different file names and formats.<br></p><p>A digital asset management software eliminates such problems by harmonizing all assets, ensuring all workers and departments have access to a single version of assets. Whenever an asset is updated, it is synchronized across departments and devices in real-time.<br></p><p>This harmonization across multiple departments ensures that every image, video, audio, and other digital content used for campaigns and other purposes are one and the same. It removes any probability of mismatches as well as the use of outdated, unapproved assets.<br></p><p><strong>3. Improve Client Relationships</strong><br></p><p>Professional photographers work with tons of digital assets on a regular basis. Thus, a digital asset management software for photographers is not surprising. In fact, most digital asset management systems are geared towards photographers along with videographers, marketers, graphic designers, and other professionals who are involved in the asset creation process.<br></p><p>Aside from organizing and tracking their photos, photographers use their digital asset management system to help them create backups of their images. This is important since they tend to work with a variety of clients, which range from individual to corporate customers.<br></p><p>With a digital asset management solution, they can safely and securely back up photos of their clients. In the event of an emergency, they can quickly retrieve their clients’ images and retain their business. In instances where clients lose or damage their copies, photographers can quickly re-furnish them with another set of images in a flash.<br></p><p>When it comes to your website, having optimized images can <a href="https://image4.io/en/blog/5-ways-to-speed-up-your-website/">speed up your website’s performance</a>. With that, pages can quickly load so your visitors won’t lose interest from waiting and stay on your site longer.<br></p><p><strong>4. Protect Your Digital Assets</strong><br></p><p>Utilizing a digital asset management software encrypts all your digital content, protecting them from unauthorized access and use. Aside from encrypting them in your storage center, a digital asset management solution also encrypts them in all channels you use for sending and sharing.<br></p><p>This reduces, if not eliminate, reliance on sharing assets via FTP. File transfer protocol, or FTP, has been the standard for sharing and sending large files during the early years of the  Internet. But FTP is known to be a risky way of sharing files. The process is insecure and unauthenticated. This means passwords are revealed in clear text, allowing unauthorized parties to access and sniff data during file transfers.<br></p><p>FTP is so risky that even the FBI advises people and companies against its use. Back in 2017, the <a href="https://www.databreachtoday.com/fbi-warns-healthcare-entities-threats-to-ftp-servers-a-9800">FBI released a report</a> stating that criminal elements are actively targeting FTP servers to steal information primarily from healthcare establishments and facilities.<br></p><p>The added protection provided by digital asset management systems ensures that your files are safe and secure during the transfer process. You can also add watermarks to boost the security of your visual assets.<br></p><p><strong>5. Sell/Distribute Your Assets Better</strong><br></p><p>If your business is into selling and/or distributing digital content, then you will boost your business productivity and profitability with a digital asset management system. Most DAM systems are built to integrate with multiple product content networks, product management software, and product information management systems. This helps you organize your libraries and assets as well as determine what content should be in line for sale or distribution.<br></p><p><strong>Tool for Improving Efficiency</strong><br></p><p>The majority of business organizations put in a substantial amount of money, time, effort, and other resources into making more digital assets. That said, it is just recently that digital asset management software is seeing widespread adoption and implementation in major business sectors and industries.<br></p><p>The reasons mentioned in the article are only some of the digital asset management examples you can utilize. And more businesses are realizing its importance. <br></p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/digital-asset-management-software-market-global-trends-share-growth-opportunity-and-2025-2019-11-05">November 2019 research by MarketWatch</a>, the digital asset management market was valued at $1.8 billion back in 2017. The increasing proliferation of digital content (images, videos, documents) will drive the demand for digital asset management systems and increase the market value to as much as $6.7 billion by 2025.<br></p><p>Companies are realizing now that the only way to get more value from their digital assets is to ensure that their team members can immediately and effortlessly locate and retrieve them whenever needed. Put another way, digital asset management software acts like an improved media library that enhances efficiency and streamlines everything. It speeds up the creative workflow by removing bottlenecks, which then results in better productivity and profitability.</p>
