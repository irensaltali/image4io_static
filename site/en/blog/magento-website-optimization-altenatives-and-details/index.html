The reason is that it does not appeal to everyone.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/marketshare.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/marketshare.png 600w, https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/marketshare.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><br>According to W3Techs data, 0.8% of all websites on the internet were created with Magento. While this data may not seem impressive, it ranks 9th out of 60 competitors and is a significant number for a service that caters to a niche audience.</p><p>As a result, Magento is a flexible and scalable platform with a well-organized set of features that enable you to bring your brand to your customers in a digital environment.</p><p>If you want to have a remarkable store with huge sales potential, you can start without fear with Magento.</p><h3 id="magento1-vs-magento2">Magento1 vs Magento2</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/magentovs.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/magentovs.png 600w, https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/magentovs.png 1000w, https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/magentovs.png 1470w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>While Magento got a loyal audience with its original version, Magento 2 was launched to resolve some of the complaints that arose, addressing drawbacks. And he certainly made many improvements.</p><p><strong>Performance and loading time</strong></p><p><strong>Magento 1</strong></p><p>Performance is one of the biggest complaints found on Magento 1. Magento 1, websites have an average loading speed of over two seconds. Page loading speed is the most important factor affecting the conversion of the website.</p><p><strong>Magento 2</strong></p><p>Product loading and home page in Magento 2 is approximately 50% faster than Magento 1. It is also faster than Magento 1 in the payment process.</p><p>While Magento2 is better than Magento 1 in terms of performance, you will still need to constantly control the performance of your website in terms of SEO.<br></p><p><strong>Mobile-friendly</strong></p><p>Shopping on mobile increases significantly every day. By looking at this, not having a mobile-friendly site is unthinkable in this world. At this point, every e-commerce site must be mobile compatible.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/mobile.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/mobile.png 600w, https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/mobile.png 1000w, https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/mobile.png 1154w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><br>According to Statista, mobile retail sales in the USA alone will reach $ 432 billion by 2022.</p><p><strong>Magento 1</strong></p><p>Mobile compatibility was one of the biggest problems found in Magento 1 after site performance. In the face of this problem, Magento developers have developed workarounds to make sites compatible with mobile devices, but they have not been very useful in the long term. The themes available on Magento 1 were not mobile-friendly.</p><p><strong>Magento 2</strong></p><p>Magento 2 is more mobile-friendly compared to Magento 1. Payment systems integrated themes for mobile have become more responsive.</p><p><strong>Admin Panel</strong></p><p>Both the performance of the website and the design and ease of use of the admin panel are important for keeping in proper communication with the customers.</p><p><strong>Magento 1</strong></p><p>The admin panel in Magento 1 was very slow and very difficult in terms of ease of use. It also had fewer dashboards than Magento 2.</p><p><strong>Magento 2</strong></p><p>Magento 2's admin panel is much more developed than Magento 1, with its advanced indicators and ease of use.</p><p>Recent orders, top keywords, best sellers, etc. many new controls are available in Magento 2' s panel.</p><p><strong>Payment Gateways</strong></p><p><strong>Magento 1</strong></p><p>Magento 1 supported many payment gateways. But it generally required a third-party integration.</p><p><strong>Magento2</strong></p><p>Apart from Magento 1, Magento 2 supports the most popular payment gateways such as PayPal, Authorize.net, and Braintree without any additional integration.</p><p><strong>Security</strong></p><p><strong>Magento 1</strong></p><p>Magento 1 no longer has any updates under the name of security. These updates and patches require expensive development costs.</p><p><strong>Magento 2</strong></p><p>With Magento 2, your site is as secure as you want.</p><p>Unlike Magento 1, there are updates and patches for security. However, you will need to manage your PCI compliance yourself.</p><h3 id="ecommerce-with-magento">eCommerce with Magento</h3><p>If you want to create an e-commerce store, choosing the right infrastructure development platform will be the most important step for you. Magento is one of the best tools of recent times to manage an e-commerce site.</p><p>Many e-commerce stores prefer Magento 2 for more advantages. Magento 2 is a preferable tool for a better UX, especially with B2B functionality.
