                        We, at image4io and its affiliates, put great efforts in making sure that we secure your personally identifiable information and use it properly.
                    </p>

                        personally identifiable information subject to the terms of this policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The summary of this policy will give you a quick and clear view of our practices. Please take the time to read our full policy.

                    <h6>The Personally Identifiable Information That You Provide</h6>
                    <p>
                        We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way.
                        You provide most of your information through forms you fill out to contact us, access the image4io platform,

                        from the payment service provider that processed your payment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When you contact us, or when we contact you, we will receive and process any personally identifiable information that you provide us.

                    <h6>The Personally Identifiable Information That We Collect</h6>
                    <p>
                        Like many websites, we use “cookies” (link to section), and we obtain information when your browser accesses our website.
                        Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your access device to the

                    <p>

                    <p>
                        The content you upload to the Service, whether from your own device or from a cloud-based hosting service, including any data, text, graphic,
                        audio and audio-visual files, may include personally identifiable information. The content that you upload and designate as public, will be
                        accessible to others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please use caution when uploading the content and avoid any involuntary disclosure of your personally identifiable information or disclosure
                        of others’ personally identifiable information without their consent.
                    </p>
                    <h6>What Do We Do With Personally Identifiable Information?</h6>
                    <p>
                        We use the personally identifiable information we collect and receive to provide the Service to you and to other users, to enable the Service’s
                        tools and features, to study and analyze the functionality of the Service and users’ activities, to provide support, to measure Service activity
                        for pricing purposes, to maintain the Service, to make it better and to continue developing the Service.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We obey the law and expect you to do the same. If necessary, we will use your personally identifiable information to enforce our terms,
                        policies and legal agreements, to comply with court orders and warrants, and assist law enforcement agencies, to collect debts, prevent fraud,
                        misappropriation, infringements, identity thefts and any other misuse of the Service, and to take any action in any legal dispute and proceeding.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We commit to process personally identifiable information solely for the purposes described in this policy.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Sharing Personally Identifiable Information with Others</h6>
                    <p>
                        We do not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information. We will share your personally identifiable information with service
                        providers and other third parties, if necessary to fulfill the purposes for collecting the information. Any such third party will commit to
                        protect your privacy as required under the applicable law and this policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, we will share your payment transaction details with the payment services providers, to process and verify your payments. We will
                        use a service provider to manage our email messages transmission.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will also share your personally identifiable information with our affiliates. These mean companies within the image4io group and
                        include subsidiaries, sister-companies and parent companies, with the express provision that their use of your personally identifiable
                        information will comply with this policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will report any content that you upload and share user personally identifiable information, if we believe, in our sole discretion
                        that such content is illegal or abusive or may violate any third party rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, a merger, acquisition or any other structural change will require us to transfer your personally identifiable information
                        to another entity, as part of the structural change, provided that the receiving entity will comply with this policy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We will be liable for onward transfers to third parties in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles. For further information, please
                        below the EU-US Privacy Shield chapter of this policy.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Accessing Your Personally Identifiable Information</h6>
                    <p>
                        If you find that the information on your account is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, please provide us the necessary information to correct it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At any time, you can contact us at: privacy@image4.io and request to access the personally identifiable information that we keep about you.
                        We will ask you to provide us certain credentials to make sure that you are who you claim to be and to the extent required under the applicable law,

                        If you are eligible for the right of access under the applicable law, you can obtain confirmation from us of whether we are processing
                        personally identifiable information about you, and receive a copy of that data, so that you could –

                                request the correction, amendment or deletion of your personally identifiable information if it is inaccurate or if you believe that the
                                processing of your personally identifiable information is in violation of the applicable law or the Privacy Shield Principles (please see
                                the EU-US Privacy Shield section in this policy for further information).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        We will use judgement and due care to redact from the data which we will make available to you, personally identifiable information related to others.

                    <h6>Information Security</h6>
                    <p>
                        We and our hosting services implement systems, applications and procedures to secure your personally identifiable information, to minimize the
                        risks of theft, damage, loss of information, or unauthorized access or use of information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These measures provide sound industry standard security. However, although we make efforts to protect your privacy, we cannot guarantee that the
                        Service will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse.
                    </p>
                    <h6>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h6>
                    <p>
                        From time to time, we will update this policy. If the updates have minor if any consequences, they will take effect 7 days after we post a
                        notice on the Service’s website. Substantial changes will be effective 30 days after we initially posted the notice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Until the new policy takes effect, if it materially reduces the protection of your privacy right under the then-existing policy you can choose
                        not to accept it and terminate your use of the Service. Continuing to use the Service after the new policy takes effect means that you agree to
                        the new policy. Note that if we need to adapt the policy to legal requirements, the new policy will become effective immediately or as required by law.
                    </p>
