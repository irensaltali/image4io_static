Here you can understand how popular WordPress has become. The fact that all kinds of content will come to mind with just clicks without requiring any coding knowledge is the most important factor in choosing WordPress so much.</p><p>Other factors include SEO-friendly code structure, thousands of templates and plugin libraries, user-friendly management panel.</p><p>WordPress is divided into two Wordpress.org and WordPress.com. The difference is as follows. You install your hosting package yourself on wordPress.org and you have full control of your website.</p><p>On Wordpress.com, you can access your website in a more limited way, and you can set up your site without having to pay any domain name. However, this domain name will be in the form of <em>examplesite.wordpress.com</em>. Not only blog pages but also e-commerce, corporate website, portfolio, ad site, etc. WordPress sites can be established in many categories.</p><p>Generally, WordPress works with the writing and page creation logic. It allows you to quickly add various categories to your website and create content belonging to them.</p><p>In addition to articles, it also supports images, video, and audio files and allows your visitors to comment.

Even though the 1-second delay may sound like nothing, it actually represents much more.</p><p>We will talk about the importance of WordPress site speed, which causes great losses, in the progress of the article. However, the first detail we need to understand here is why your site is slow.</p><p>Now we're going to share with you the most common details that cause your website to slow down.</p><p>1) Having a low or slow hosting service that is not suitable for your website traffic or level.</p><p>2) Although you have high traffic, there is no content delivery network CDN to accommodate it.</p><p>3) Not caching or using caching plugins.</p><p>4) If you couldn't do any optimization or compression for your images.</p><p>5) Using plugins that are outdated or slow.</p><p>These 5 reasons are the biggest factor in slowing down your website.</p><h3 id="why-is-a-fast-website-important">Why is a fast website important?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/fast-loading-speed-website.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/fast-loading-speed-website.png 600w, https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/fast-loading-speed-website.png 800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Having a slow website means you lose potential customers before they even enter your site. And getting a new customer always costs more. According to a case study by strange loop, a 1 second delay in any website results in 7% fewer conversions, 11% fewer page views, and 16% less customer satisfaction.</p><p>In addition to all these losses, it has now begun to lead Google to optimize websites for speed. Slow websites are no longer indexed by Google, but not showing on the first page. Especially in these days where content is everything, it is a loss of all kinds that our SEO work cannot be valued due to the slow site.</p><p>If we show you how important website speed is and what kind of benefits you may encounter when you speed up your site, through some examples;</p><ul><li>Amazon increases its revenue by 1% for every 100 milliseconds of improvement.<br></li><li>Shopzilla saw a 12% increase in revenue by reducing landing page time from 6 seconds to 1.2 seconds. However, page views also experienced an increase of 25%.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2016, AliExpress increased page load time by 36%, and its orders increased by 27%.</li></ul><ul><li>Mozilla accelerated the landing page by 2.2 seconds and increased the download rate by 15.5%. This means an additional 60 million Firefox downloads per year.</li></ul><ul><li>In contrast to accelerations, the BBC reported losing more than 10% users for each slow loading second.</li></ul><p>The conclusion to be drawn from this data is that you measure the speed of the website as soon as possible and optimize it to accelerate accordingly.</p><h3 id="wordpress-website-optimization">WordPress Website Optimization</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/Ekran-Resmi-2021-01-30-20.44.24.png" class="kg-image" alt srcset="https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/01/Ekran-Resmi-2021-01-30-20.44.24.png 600w, https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/01/Ekran-Resmi-2021-01-30-20.44.24.png 1000w, https://image4.io/en/blog/content/images/2021/01/Ekran-Resmi-2021-01-30-20.44.24.png 1540w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>After being aware of the importance of the website opening speed and the factors that cause the slowdown, let's look at how I can optimize the website in order.</p><p><strong>1) Optimize your images</strong></p><p>The pictures on your website have a significant effect on slowing down even if you are not aware of it. Because images take up a lot of space on your website, unfortunately, it is not enough to just shrink it to HTML to fix this here. Because shrinking the images as HTML affects only the appearance on the page, not the actual size of the images.</p><p>To increase the loading speed of the page, you should prefer standard image formats such as JPG, PNG.</p><p>Photoshop etc. to reduce the size of your images. you can use. However, it is very time-consuming to manually optimize each visual. We will talk about the optimizing tools that do these for you.</p><p><strong>2) Getting rid of plugins you don't use</strong></p><p>The open-source code of WordPress enables the development of websites in a variety of ways. Plugins, which are an integral part of WordPress sites, are there for you without the need for any coding knowledge. With plugins, you can optimize your website very quickly and properly.</p><p>If we add too many plugins whose main purpose is to increase the performance of websites, it will slow down.</p><p><strong>3) Optimize your caching</strong></p><p>Every visitor to your website uploads website images, java, and CSS files, which affects the loading speed of your site. You can prevent this situation by using the HHTP caching system. With this state, you can ensure that the files are stored thanks to the family sources browser and PROXY.</p><p>This way, when the page is reloaded by that user, the files are loaded again from the cache instead of being downloaded again. By optimizing your site with the caching system, it will also reduce your bandwidth costs.</p><p><strong>4) Lower the DNS settings</strong></p><p>DNS searches or DNS lookups occur when any URL address is typed into a browser. At the end of the search, the DNS resolver finds and returns a return to the IP address of the server. This process takes between 20-120 milliseconds on average.</p><p>Having more than one hostname will increase your DNS settings page loading speed. it will also increase the number of parallel downloads.</p><p><strong>5) Remove unnecessary HTML and CSS code</strong></p><p>By removing unnecessary HTML and CSS code, you will be doing your website a big favor. If you are using CMS (content management system) like WordPress, the theme you choose has CSS id elements that are ready beforehand. You can increase the performance of your website by removing the id descriptions from the ready codes and removing the unused CSS classes.</p><p><strong>6) Reduce HTTP requests</strong></p><p>First, reduce the number of requests for your images by using CSS Sprites. Then remove the background-image elements from your images to get a single image. Then combine the inline images with cached style sheets. This way you can keep your HTTP requests under control.</p><p><strong>7) Use CDN</strong></p><p>With CDN (content delivery network), you can keep in your cache the copy of the most requested content on your website and on the server-side. In this way, users on your website will be able to access the content they want faster.</p><h3 id="optimization-tools-and-plugin">Optimization tools and plugin</h3><p>WordPress, which has open code, gives users the chance to make unlimited editing on their websites.
