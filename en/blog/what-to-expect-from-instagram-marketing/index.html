<p>Given that Instagram has reached monthly 1 billion active users in 2019, the platform has great role in today’s internet users. The platform first launched in 2010 as an iPhone app, and reached 1 million users in just 2 months, back in that day. Compared to Twitter and Foursquare, which reached 1 million monthly users in 2 years, Instagram is number one social platform for many users. While Instagram changed the way of social media through communication, engagement and inspiration, it also became a huge marketing channel for brands. The statistics show that 25 million brands have Instagram accounts, and 80% of Instagram users follow at least one brand. So, why Instagram became so popular and active in our lives, and why should brands pay attention to Instagram marketing?</p><ul>
<li><strong>User Friendliness</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>First of all, Instagram’s success can be explained with its user friendliness. The application interface is designed to be used and understood easily. Also, Instagram concentrates on mobile, which contributes to engagement in daily life. It first launched as a mobile app, and still some features are found only in mobile app rather than website. Thus, the social photo sharing application becomes much more accessible and instant as it promises. The application provides easy to use snap, edit, filter tools and fast loading feed for its users. Finally, the user actions are also designed to be easy and fun: double tap for likes, scrolling down for seeing further.</p><ul>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While other social media platforms are based on sharing thoughts and life events, Instagram focuses on creativity through visuality. Visuality makes the platform more personal and differentiated. Instagram is a social media platform which puts images on the center and supports the personalized posts through hashtags. It becomes much more easier and exciting to share instant moments, daily activities or even outfits. The platform draws its strength from the users’ eagerness to create something about themselves. Overall, Instagram is all about sprinkling inspiration over daily routines. Instagram also changed the way of photography of course, the statistics show that every pictures taken in 2 minutes now exceeds total number of photos taken during 19<sup>th</sup>century.</p><ul>
<li><strong>It is all about engagement</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Creativity turns Instagram into a platform where people create their portfolio, visual diary or artsy place. This helps Instagram to become more involved in daily lives. The “followers” attribute instead of friends list makes this platform even more influencing. People can follow various accounts to get inspired, have ideas or even get updated instantly. The platform has formed its own habits, for example the hashtag usage can be personal or refer to brands. The challenges or habits such as “throwbackthursday” encourage people to involve more and more.</p><p>In the end of the day, Instagram becomes a naturally dynamic marketing platform for brands as well. Since the inspiration is at the center of the platform, brands can engage with their followers or promote their products. For example, the statistics indicate that 70% of most used hashtags are branded. Another important statistic is that e<a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/15-09-15-how_does_your_brand_stack_up_on_facebook_twitter_and_instagram/">ngagement with brands</a> on Instagram is 10 times higher than Facebook, 54 times higher than Pinterest, and 84 times higher than Twitter.</p><p>On the other hand, Instagram’s visuality and belongingness also encourages users to join into marketing process. Influencer marketing becomes more and more important in these days, since people prefer to trust people they can relate themselves to, not only big name celebrities. In Instagram, micro marketing has as much importance as macro marketing since they promote the products and promotions more realistically. Also, the dynamic platform has given rise to user generated content which marketers love. Branded challenges or campaigns encourage people to share their personal experiences which eventually becomes free marketing of the brand. This can be associated with word-of-mouth way of traditional marketing, but in a much more dynamic way.</p><p>Besides all of these features, Instagram also keeps providing marketing advantages for the brands. For example, in-app purchases facilitates promotions even more. Brands can post their stylish-inspirational pictures, and any user can simply view the prices and buy the products through Instagram. Given that 60% of Instagram users discover new products on this platform, this is a huge advantage for brands.</p><p>Finally, visual marketing has a huge role in marketing with the rise of visual social platforms, especially Instagram. Visuality contributes to marketing efforts of brands through customer engagement. Images are extremely helpful when it comes to attract potential customers in the blink of an eye, especially in today’s competitive market conditions. Creative part of Instagram also supports customer engagement, leading to bilateral communication between parties.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong></p>
