                    <h5>19. MISCELLANEOUS</h5>

                    <p>
                        These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding the Services. These Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any other electronic or written agreement you may have with image4io for the Services or for any other image4io product or service or otherwise. In the event of any conflict between these Terms and any other agreement you may have with image4io, the terms of that other agreement will control only if these Terms are specifically identified and declared to be overridden by such other agreement. Nothing in these Terms creates or can be construed to create an employer/employee, joint venture, or partnership relationship between you and image4io. Except as otherwise expressly elsewhere in these Terms, there will be no third party beneficiaries to these Terms. image4io&#39;s failure or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes unlawful, void, or otherwise unenforceable (including the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above), then that provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will continue in full force and effect. image4io will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from any event beyond image4io&#39;s reasonable control, including, but not limited to, flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of God, fire, war, insurrection, riot, labor dispute, accident, action of government, communications, power failure, or equipment or software malfunction. Headings of sections are for convenience only and will not be used to limit or construe such sections. As used in these Terms, &quot;including&quot; means &quot;including (without limitation).&quot; You may not assign or transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without prior written consent from image4io. image4io may assign or transfer any or all of its rights under these Terms, in whole or in part, without obtaining your consent or approval.
                    </p>
